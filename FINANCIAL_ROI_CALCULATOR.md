## 📊 ROI CALCULATOR FORMULA

### 🏦 Financial ROI Formula
```
Total Investment = Initial Cost + Annual Operating Cost
Total Savings = Compliance Savings + Fraud Prevention + Efficiency Savings
Net ROI = Total Savings - Total Investment
ROI Percentage = (Net ROI / Total Investment) × 100
```

### 📈 Example Calculation
```
Total Investment = $200,000 + $40,000 = $240,000
Total Savings = $300,000 + $25,000,000 + $425,000 = $25,725,000
Net ROI = $25,725,000 - $240,000 = $25,485,000
ROI Percentage = ($25,485,000 / $240,000) × 100 = 10619%
```
