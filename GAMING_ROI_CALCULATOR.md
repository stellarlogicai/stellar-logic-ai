## 📊 ROI CALCULATOR FORMULA

### 🎮 Gaming ROI Formula
```
Total Investment = Initial Cost + Annual Operating Cost
Total Savings = Cheating Prevention + Tournament Revenue + Retention Savings
Net ROI = Total Savings - Total Investment
ROI Percentage = (Net ROI / Total Investment) × 100
```

### 📈 Example Calculation
```
Total Investment = $75,000 + $15,000 = $90,000
Total Savings = $50,000,000 + $25,000,000 + $8,000,000 = $83,000,000
Net ROI = $83,000,000 - $90,000 = $82,910,000
ROI Percentage = ($82,910,000 / $90,000) × 100 = 92123%
```
