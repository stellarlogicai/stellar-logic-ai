## 📊 ROI CALCULATOR FORMULA

### 🏥 Healthcare ROI Formula
```
Total Investment = Initial Cost + Annual Operating Cost
Total Savings = Compliance Savings + Security Savings + Efficiency Savings
Net ROI = Total Savings - Total Investment
ROI Percentage = (Net ROI / Total Investment) × 100
```

### 📈 Example Calculation
```
Total Investment = $150,000 + $30,000 = $180,000
Total Savings = $200,000 + $3,915,000 + $160,000 = $4,275,000
Net ROI = $4,275,000 - $180,000 = $4,095,000
ROI Percentage = ($4,095,000 / $180,000) × 100 = 2275%
```
