## 📊 ROI CALCULATOR FORMULA

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity ROI Formula
```
Total Investment = Initial Cost + Annual Operating Cost
Total Savings = Incident Prevention + Operations Efficiency + Downtime Reduction + Insurance Savings
Net ROI = Total Savings - Total Investment
ROI Percentage = (Net ROI / Total Investment) × 100
```

### 📈 Example Calculation
```
Total Investment = $250,000 + $60,000 = $310,000
Total Savings = $3,915,000 + $600,000 + $400,000 + $40,000 = $4,955,000
Net ROI = $4,955,000 - $310,000 = $4,645,000
ROI Percentage = ($4,645,000 / $310,000) × 100 = 1498%
```
