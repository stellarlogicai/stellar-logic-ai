Subject: AI Security Collaboration for Innersloth

Hi Marcus,

I came across your profile and was really impressed by your journey from the ISP/telecom industry to co-founding Innersloth and creating the phenomenon that is Among Us. That's an incredible entrepreneurial story that shows your ability to identify opportunities and execute on them.

As someone who specializes in AI security for gaming companies, I'm fascinated by the technical challenges you must have faced scaling Among Us from a small indie studio to a global success, especially protecting it from the sophisticated cheating that emerged as the game grew.

At Stellar Logic AI, I help gaming companies navigate the complex intersection of AI and security:
• Identify AI vulnerabilities in multiplayer game systems
• Implement AI-powered threat detection and prevention
• Protect game integrity and player experience
• Provide strategic AI security consulting for growing studios

I offer a comprehensive AI Security Audit ($5K-$15K) that helps gaming companies identify and address security vulnerabilities before they impact their player base.

Given your technical background and experience scaling Innersloth, I'd be interested to hear about your perspective on AI security challenges in gaming and perhaps explore how our expertise could complement each other's work.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call this week to discuss AI security in the gaming industry?

Best regards,
Jamie
