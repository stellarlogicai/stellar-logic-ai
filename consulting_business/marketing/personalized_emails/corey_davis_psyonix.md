Subject: AI Security Assessment for Rocket League Live Operations

Hi Corey,

I came across your profile and was impressed by your transition from Design Director to Director of Live Operations at Psyonix. That's a fascinating career move that shows your deep understanding of both game development and the critical importance of live operations.

As Rocket League continues to grow in competitive gaming, I'm seeing increasingly sophisticated AI-driven cheating methods that traditional anti-cheat systems struggle to detect. These AI exploits can undermine competitive integrity and player trust - exactly the areas you're managing in live operations.

At Stellar Logic AI, I specialize in helping gaming companies strengthen their security against these emerging AI threats:
• Identify AI-powered cheating vulnerabilities in real-time competitive environments
• Strengthen live operations security systems against coordinated AI attacks
• Protect player experience and competitive integrity
• Implement proactive AI security monitoring for live services

I offer a comprehensive AI Security Audit ($5K-$15K) that typically identifies 5-10 critical vulnerabilities most gaming studios miss in their live operations security.

Given your expertise with Rocket League's live ecosystem, I'd be interested to learn about your current security challenges and perhaps explore how my AI security expertise could complement your live operations work.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call this week to discuss enhancing Rocket League's AI security posture?

Best regards,
Jamie
