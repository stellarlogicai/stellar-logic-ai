Subject: AI Security for Warframe Community & Live Operations

Hi Rebecca,

Congratulations on your recent promotion to Creative Director at Digital Extremes! I've been following Warframe's success and your work in community management, so it's great to see your expertise recognized with this expanded role.

As Warframe continues to grow with millions of players, I'm seeing increasingly sophisticated AI-driven exploits and security challenges that can impact both player experience and community trust. Your background in live operations and community management gives you unique insight into protecting these complex gaming ecosystems.

At Stellar Logic AI, I specialize in helping gaming companies secure their live service games and communities:
• Identify AI-powered vulnerabilities in live gaming environments
• Strengthen community security systems against AI-driven threats
• Protect player experience and community integrity
• Implement proactive AI security monitoring for live services

I offer a comprehensive AI Security Audit ($5K-$15K) that helps gaming companies identify and address security vulnerabilities in their live operations and community management.

Given your deep experience with Warframe's community and live operations, I'd be interested to learn about your current security challenges and discuss how my AI security expertise could support your expanded role as Creative Director.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call this week to discuss enhancing Warframe's AI security capabilities?

Best regards,
Jamie
