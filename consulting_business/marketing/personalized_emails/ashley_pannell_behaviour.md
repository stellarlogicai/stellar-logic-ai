Subject: AI Security for Among Us Live Operations

Hi Ashley,

I've been following Behaviour Interactive's success with Among Us and was really impressed when I saw your transition from Creative Director to Head of Live Operations. That move demonstrates your versatility and deep understanding of both game development and the critical importance of maintaining secure multiplayer environments.

As Among Us continues to face sophisticated AI-driven cheating attempts that threaten social deduction gameplay, I'm helping gaming companies strengthen their multiplayer security systems. These AI exploits can bypass traditional anti-cheat measures and undermine the trust that makes Among Us special.

At Stellar Logic AI, I specialize in protecting multiplayer games like Among Us:
• Identify AI-powered cheating vulnerabilities in real-time multiplayer systems
• Strengthen anti-cheat systems against coordinated AI attacks
• Protect social deduction mechanics and player experience
• Implement proactive AI security monitoring for live games

I offer a comprehensive AI Security Audit ($5K-$15K) that typically identifies critical vulnerabilities most multiplayer studios miss in their security systems.

Given your direct experience managing Among Us's live operations, I'd love to learn about your current security challenges and discuss how my AI security expertise could help protect the integrity of social deduction gameplay.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call this week to discuss enhancing Among Us's AI security capabilities?

Best regards,
Jamie
